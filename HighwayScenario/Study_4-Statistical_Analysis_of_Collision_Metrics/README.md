# Statistical Analysis of Collision Metrics

## Objective
This focuses on conducting multiple traffic simulations in SUMO, altering various parameters like tau, collisionmingap, sigmaerror, and emergency deceleration to examine the outcomes, especially regarding collision-related data using mean and variance statistics.

## Vehicle Types and Flows
Defined vehicle types ('vType') and traffic flows ('flow') in SUMO simulations:

1. **DEFAULT_KRAUSS**: Represents a yellow vehicle, designed to avoid collisions.
2. **DEFAULT_VEHTYPE**: Represents a red vehicle, designed with a higher likelihood of causing collisions.

Total of 10 vehicle flows are defined, comprising mixes of both DEFAULT_KRAUSS and DEFAULT_VEHTYPE vehicles.

## Scenarios

## Scenario 1 - Parameter Analysis
In-depth analysis of collisions between Default and ego vehicles on a highway, altering one simulation attribute at a time to identify the responsible parameters for collisions.

### Results
- **CollisionMinGapFactor**: Analyzed through heatmap and bar plots, showing varying collision counts with different parameter values.
- **Sigma Error**: Demonstrated a positive correlation between higher sigma error values and increased collision rates.
- **EmergencyDecel**: Slight influence on collision outcomes, with minor variations in mean and variance of collision occurrences.
- **Tau**: Inverse relationship with collision count; higher Tau values lead to fewer collisions.

## Scenario 2 - Vehicle Type Variation
Variation of specific parameters within the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) to represent different driver behaviors:

- **Desired Speed (vdes)**
- **Minimum Headway Distance (dmin)**
- **Desired Time Headway (Ï„)**
- **Maximum Acceleration (amax)**
- **Comfortable Deceleration (bcomf)**

### Sumo Configuration
Defined characteristics and behavior of different vehicle types within the simulation.

### Collision Trends
- **Aggressive Vehicles**: More collisions with increased traffic congestion.
- **Tailgater Vehicles**: Similar trend to aggressive vehicles with an increase in collision counts.
- **Passive Vehicles**: Lack of collision data.
- **Speeder Vehicles**: Low collision counts in low to moderately congested traffic; data beyond 30 vehicles is lacking.

## Key Takeaways
Aggressive and tailgater vehicles tend to be involved in more collisions as traffic increases. The behavior of passive and speeder vehicles requires further data for comprehensive analysis.
