# Study 1 - Exploring  SUMO Simulator

"Simulation of Urban Mobility" ([SUMO]) is a versatile, open-source traffic simulation tool that offers microscopic and continuous modeling capabilities, specifically engineered to manage extensive network systems.

## Requirements
- [SUMO simulator] 

## Scenarios
I simulated five collision scenarios in SUMO, all involving accidents caused by an EGO VEHICLE.
1. [Scenario 1]: 3 Lane 4 Way intersection (with TRAFFIC LIGHTS) collision at an intersection
by an EGO-VEHICLE (Krauss Car following model) that doesnâ€™t follow traffic rules.
2. [Scenario 2]: 3 Lane 4 Way intersection (with TRAFFIC LIGHTS) rear collision at lane by
an EGO-VEHICLE (EIDM car following collision parameters) with set collision
parameters.
3. [Scenario 3]: 1 Lane 4 Way intersection (with RIGHT-OF-WAY) collision at the junction
by an EGO-VEHICLE (Junction collision and EIDM collision parameters).
4. [Scenario 4]: 3 Lane 4 Way intersection (with TRAFFIC LIGHTS) collision at the junction
by an EGO-VEHICLE (Junction collision and EIDM collision parameters) but EGOVEHICLES follow traffic rules.
5. [Scenario 5]: 3 Lane 4 Way intersection (with TRAFFIC LIGHTS) rear collision due to lane
change by an EGO-VEHICLE (EIDM and Lane change collision parameters).

For more details on the scenarios and vehicle parameters refer the [report_5_10_23]

Note: I didn't include all the CSV files that were converted from the XML files to conserve repository space. However, you can convert these files using the [xml2csv] Python script provided by SUMO. Additionally, I removed the [Full output XML] files from all scenarios due to their substantial file size.
