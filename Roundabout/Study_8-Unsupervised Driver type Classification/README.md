# Unsupervised Driver Type Classification

## Data Preprocessing
The project begins with preprocessing SUMO simulation data, transforming it for effective analysis and model training.

### Process Steps
- Cleaning and organizing data.
- Normalizing features for uniformity.

## Unsupervised Learning Models
We employ unsupervised learning models to uncover hidden patterns in the simulation data without predefined labels.

### Models Used
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Deep Neural Networks

## Dimensionality Reduction
Dimensionality reduction techniques are applied to simplify the dataset, enhancing model performance and interpretability.

### Techniques
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)

## Results and Analysis
Our analysis reveals key insights into traffic behavior and classification accuracy of different vehicle types.

### Key Findings
- Effectiveness of Random Forest in capturing complex data relationships.
- Importance of feature selection in model accuracy.
